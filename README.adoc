== 💤 Billy Idle - Lightweight MacOS (In)activity Tracker

Simple busy / idle time tracker inspired by the ancient article https://www.dssw.co.uk/blog/2015-01-21-inactivity-and-idle-time/[Inactivity and Idle Time on OS X]. Background:  OS X has a timer called HIDIdleTime that tracks the last time you interacted with the computer.

== Database Support

*Billy Idle* currently only support a local https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite[sqlite] database, more precisely `modernc.org/sqlite` which is a cgo-free port of SQLite. But it shouldn't be a big deal to add support for a remote https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] Database.
