== 💤 Billy Idle - Lightweight macOS (In)activity Tracker

Simple busy / idle time tracker inspired by the ancient article https://www.dssw.co.uk/blog/2015-01-21-inactivity-and-idle-time/[Inactivity and Idle Time on OS X].


== Background

According to the article, OS X has a timer called *HIDIdleTime* that tracks the last time you interacted with the computer, e.g. moved the mouse, typed a key, or interacted with the computer.

*billy-idle* simply queries this value periodically using the `ioreg` utility that ships with macOS, and matches it against a pre-defined threshold. If exceeded, it will create a record for the busy time period in database. This data can later be used as input for time tracking tools or statistics.

== Run form source

== Database Support

*Billy Idle* currently only support a local https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite[sqlite] database, more precisely `modernc.org/sqlite` which is a cgo-free port of SQLite. But it shouldn't be a big deal to add support for a remote https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] Database.
